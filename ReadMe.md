To Run:

1)Download project files from git

2)Place your excel files in the data folder, and in the test folder
  place your test files 

3)Update configs.py file to your needs

  files_path  

    update if you want to not use the data folder but some other folder you might want, for ease it should be inside the directory 


include_types 

    list with the data types (file extension) that you want to consider
    in the calculations. if you want to add a new one , add an element to list like
    include_types = ['a','b'] where a , b file types

exclude_strings 

    ignores all files with name containg the string.
    Useful if there are test files, or helper files in the data folder that you want to reject


sorting_orders 

    list of dictionaries. 

    4 dictionaries , each representing a different type of order
    The first dictionary - how the order for calculation of IFA will be
    
    The second dictionary - how the order for calculation of perfect order (denominator in PopX,Pop General)
    
    The third dictionary - how the order for calculation of nominator for optimal in pop general
    
    The fourth dictionary - how th order for calculation of nominator for worse in pop general


start_value, end_value , step

    configurable values for popX. Usually are 10,50,5
    but can be changeable to user needs

get_configs 

    how the file output will be named

normalize_json

    a dictionary of dictionaries
    change optimal and worst to need, careful about 
    the field of choice


To Run the code
    
    If python installed - skip
    1) https://www.python.org/downloads/ Download python from here (usually the latest)
    2) Install the exe file . When asked : click yes on add python to enviroment variables
    
    If pip installed - skip
    1) https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows
    2) Follow the tutorial
  
    From CMD go to your directory using CD (changes depending on pc/storage place etc)
    When inside the jonidas_project folder type :
    
    python -m venv venv - only use this the first time (it creates a packaged virtual env)
    venv\Scripts\activate - This part activates the virtual env , so you dont have to install any tool directly in pc
    pip install numpy - Installs numpy - do it only if you plan to run auc_generate
    python main.py - Runs the code

    The code will run and when it finishes (averaged 1.25 seconds per file(
    it will create 2 excel files , 1 with non normalized data, one with normalized))

    possible arguments
    
    instead of just running python main.py you can write
    python main.py column_name1 column_name2 column_name3 (even all the possible columns)
    
    where column_name1, column_name_2, column_name3 are the names of the column from the below list
    IFA poptX Precision_0.5 Recall F1 MAP AUC G_Measure MCC avgPopt
    so an example
    python main.py IFA Recall F1 MCC AUC
    will generate  excel files with IFA, recall,f1, mcc, auc columns (will also be automatically applied for normalized)

Extension : 
    
    auc_generate 
    A python script that will calculate AUC for steps 10,2,1,0.1,0.01 and generate the excel
    
    to run it :
    
    python auc_generate

    Uses Numpy library, a fast data processing library. Output file name is auc_output
